Action to 
Adopt 
Changes to the Committee™s Rules 
Regarding Availability of Information
 By unanimous vote, the 
Committee appro
ved a final rule 
that revises its
 Rules Regarding Availability of Infor-
mation, which are the Committee™s Freedom of Infor-

mation Act 
(FOIA) 
rules.
  The revised FOIA rules, 
which include a range of minor and technical updates, 
will become effe
ctive 30 days after the forthcoming pub-
lication of the final rule in the 
Federal Register
. 
Developments in Financial Markets and Open 

Market Operations
 The manager turned first to a discussion of financial 

market developments.  In the United States, the 
trend 

toward higher longer
-term yields observed in recent 
months accelerated over the intermeeting period
, and 
far
-forward real rate
s 
based on Treasury 
Inflation
- 
Protected 
Securities
 (TIPS)
 rose
 considerably
.  Market 
participants highlighted an improving economic out-

look, bolstered by passage of the American Rescue Plan
 (ARP)
 and progress on vaccinations
, as underlying the 
increase in yields.  Model
- 
and survey
-based estimates 
suggested that a significant portion of the increase in 
yields was associated wi
th an increase in term premiums.  
Higher term premiums could reflect the outlook for 

more expansive fiscal policy and an associated upward 

revision in the expected path for Treasury debt out-

standing.  Increased uncertainty over the outlook for 
longer
-term 
interest rates as well as technical factors may 
also have contributed to the rise in term premiums.  The 
Treasury market functioned well over most of the pe-

riod, 
although
 measures of market liquidity deteriorated 
somewhat toward the end of February.  Cond
itions 
gradually
 improved, although
 some measures of market 
liquidity ha
d 
not fully returned to earlier levels.  
    Rates implied by interest rate futures maturing over the 
next several years rose notably over the intermeeting pe-
riod, reportedly reflecting 
a reassessment by market par-
ticipants of the expected path of the target range for the 

federal funds rate.  Since the January meeting, the date 

of the first increase in the target range for the federal 
funds rate implied by a straight read of market pricin
g moved notably 
earlier 
to the first quarter of 2023, and 
the implied target rate at the end of 2023 rose around 
50 basis points.  
However, responses to the Open Mar-
ket 
Desk surveys suggested more modest changes
 to 
policy rate expectations
.  The probability
-weighted mean 
survey expectation for the target rate at the end of 2023 

rose only around 5 basis points.  
 Expectations for economic conditions at the time of the 

first increase in the target range, as measured by the 

Desk surveys, appeared to remain broadly consistent 

with the Committee™s policy framework and forward 
guidance.  Expectations from the Desk surveys for the 
path of asset purchases were little changed.  
Contacts
 noted that these expectations have b
een held steady by 

policymaker communications emphasizing both the 
need to see realized progress toward the Committee™s 
goals and the intent to communicate well in advance of
 the time when progress could be judged substantial 

enough to warrant a change in 
the pace of purchases.
  
Alongside the rise in U.S. yields, broad U.S. equity price 

indexes increased moderately
, with the largest gains in 
cyclically sensitive sectors.  The rise in U.S. yields was 

also 
accompanied by increases in sovereign yields in 
other
 advanced economies. 
 Some central banks re-
sponded to these yield increases with adjustments to op-

erations; others suggested that the rising yields reflected 

improvements in the outlook.  
 The deputy manager discussed the evolution of the Fed-
eral Reserve™s
 balance sheet and related developments in 
money markets.  Reserve balances rose 
more than
 $400 
billion
, on net
, over the intermeeting period to 
$3.7 
trillion
, while Treasury bills outstanding decreased 
more than
 $200 billion.  Against this backdrop, the 
ef-
fective
 federal funds rate softened modestly
, while 
re-
purchase agreement (
repo
) 
rates declined to a greater ex-
tent.  Moreover, market participants projected that 
re-

serves 
would
 grow at a historically rapid pace 
in coming 
months
, 
reflecting continued expansion of the Federal 
Reserve™s balance sheet along with a projected draw-
down in the balances maintained in the Treasury General 
Account.  Market contacts suggested that continued 

rapid expansion of reserves could put further downward 

pressure on money market rates.  The deputy manager 
noted that the earliest and most pronounced pressure 

was likely to be observed in 
overnight 
secured 
financing 
markets, and there could be increasing usage of the 
over-

night reverse rep
urchase agreement (ON RRP
) 
facility.
 In light of the potential for expanded use of the ON 

RRP facility, 
the 
staff had conducted a review to ensure 
that the terms of the facility and its counterparty base 

were well positioned to continue to support 
effectiv
e policy implementation.  By offering a broad range of 

money market lenders an outside investment option, the 
ON RRP 
facility 
enhances lenders™ bargaining power in 
negotiating 
rates on short
-term 
private investments
 and 
thus helps establish a floor on 
overnight 
money market 
rates
.  The facility can also alleviate downward pressure 
on overnight
 rates associated with reserve growth by 
broadening the range of liabilities that support 
the Fed-
eral Reserve™s 
balance sheet expansion.  The review rec-

ommended raisin
g the ON RRP 
per
-counterparty 
limit 
from $30 billion to $80 billion.  The $30 billion 
limit 
had 
been established a number of years ago, and the amount 

of credit intermediated through money markets had 

grown substantially since then.  The increase in the 
li
mit 
to $80 billion would restore the capacity of the facility 

relative to the aggregate size of money fund counterpar-

ties to roughly the level in place when the facility was 

established.  
The staff would also monitor money market 
conditions on an ongoing basis to assess whether any 
additional adjustments were needed to the ON RRP fa-

cility terms.
 In addition to changes to the ON RRP parameters, the 
deputy manager also noted that 
the Federal Reserve 
could consider 
adjust
ing its
 administered rates if undue 
downward pressure on overnight rates emerged.  
Re-

sponses to the 
Desk survey
s 
indicated that many market 
participants anticipated adjustments to 
the 
interest on 
excess reserves 
rate
 and the ON RRP rate at or before 
the June meet
ing.  
Finally, 
in light of more normal 
con-
ditions in agency commercial mortgage
-backed securi-
ties (
CMBS
) 
markets
, the Desk planned to conduct 
agency CMBS operations as needed to 
sustain smooth 

market functioning but would cease regularly scheduled 

CMBS ope
rations.
 In their discussion following the Desk briefings, partici-

pants noted that the ON RRP facility had been very ef-

fective in establishing a firm floor for the federal funds 

rate and supporting monetary policy implementation.  
Participants commented that the facility would continue 
to be an important part of the monetary policy imple-

mentation framework going forward, particularly in 
   coming months 
with
 reserve levels 
projected to 
rise rap-
idly.  Participants broadly supported the proposed in-
crease in the 
counterparty
 limit
, and a few participants 
also noted that they would support removing the 
limit 
altogether.  A few participants suggested that some type 

of dynamic or differential 
limit 
could be considered in 
the future to 
enable the ON RRP facility 
to adapt more 
readily to market developments.  A few participants 

noted that the concerns at the time the facility was es-

tablished 
about possible adverse effects of the ON RRP 
facility on financial stability and the structure of money 

markets 
had not materialized.  Indeed, over the spring 
of 2020, the facility played an important role in helping 

stabilize money market conditions.  
In light of the po-
tential for
 greater 
use of 
the 
ON RRP 
facility going for-
ward in connection with the expansion of the Federal 

Reserve™s balance sheet and associated downward pres-

sure on overnight rates, a couple of participants 
noted 
that it might be useful to review 
lessons learned 
regard-
ing the ON RRP facility 
since 
its inception. 
 Following the discussion, the Chair noted the 
potential 

for downward pressure on money market rates and sug-
gested that, should undue downward pressure on over-
night rates emerge, it might be appropriate to implement 

adjustments to administered rates at upcoming meetings 

or even between meetings to supp
ort effective policy im-
plementation and ensure that the federal funds rate re-
mains 
well within the target range.  
 By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk
™s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period.  No 
intervention operations occurred
 in foreign currencies 
for the System
™s account during the intermeeting period.
 Staff Review of the Economic Situation
 The COVID
-19 pandemic and the measures undertaken 
to contain its spread continued to affect economic activ-
ity in the United States and abroad.  The information 

available at the time of the March
 16Œ17 meeting sug-
gested that U.S. real gross domestic product
 (GDP) 
was 
expanding in the first quarter of 2021 at a pace that was 

faster than in the fourth quarter of last year, 
although
 the 
level 
of real GDP had likely not yet returned to the level 
seen before the onset of the pandemic.  Labor market 

conditions improved in January and February, but em-

ployment was still well below its level at the start of 2020.  

Consumer price inflation through Jan
uary
Šas measured 
by the 12
-month percentage change in the price index
 for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)
Šre-
mained well below 2
 percent.
 Total nonfarm payroll employment increased solidly 
over January and February after softening at the end of 
last year.  As of February, payroll employment had re-
traced somewhat more than half of the losses seen 
since
 the onset of the pandemic.  The unemployment rate fell 

to 6.2
 percent in February.  The unemployment rates for 
Hispanics and Asians declined, on balance, over January 

and February, while the unemployment rate for African 
Americans was unchanged on net; the rates for both Af-
rican Americans and Hispanics remained well above the 

national average.  Even though the labor force participa-

tion rate edged down, the employment
-to
-population ra-
tio moved up somewhat over January and February
; 

both measures remained below their pre
-pandemic lev-
els
.  Initial c
laims for unemployment insurance in early 
March were at their lowest level since November of last 
year.  Weekly estimates of private
-sector payrolls con-
structed by Federal Reserve Board staff using data pro-
vided by the payroll processor ADP indicated that 
the 

four
-week average increase in private employment at the 
end of February was about the same as it had been in the 

middle of the month, when the Bureau of Labor Statis-

tics collects payroll employment data.
 Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 5
.3 
per-
cent over the 12
 months ending in February, and labor 
compensation per hour in the business sector increased 

6.6 percent over the four quarters of 2020.  The gains in 

both these measures, however, continued to be domi-
nated by changes in the composition of the workforce
.  In particular,
 the concentration of job losses among 
lower
-wage workers since early last year 
had 
result
ed
 in 
outsized increases in average hourly earnings and com-

pensation per hour that were not indicative of tight labor 
market conditions.  By contrast, the employment cost 

index of total hourly compensation in the private sector 

rose 2.6
 percent over the 12 months of last year, and a 
staff estimate of the 12
-month change in the median 
wage derived from the ADP data was 3.2
 percent in 
Jan-
uary.  These measures are likely to have been less af-

fected by changes in workforce composition, and they 
were rising more slowly than their pre
-pandemic pace. 
 Total PCE price inflation was 1.5
 percent over the 
12 months ending in January and continued
 to be held 
down by slack in resource utilization.  Core PCE price 

inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy 
prices and many consumer food prices, also was 1.5
 per-
cent over the 12
 months ending in January, while the 
trimmed mean measure of 12
-mo
nth PCE inflation con-
structed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 

1.7 
percent in January.  In February, the 12
-month 
change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 1.7
 per-
cent, while core CPI inflation was 1.3
 percent over the 
same period.  The latest 
readings on survey
-based 
   measures of longer
-run 
inflation expectations were little 
changed on balance.  In early March, the University of 
Michigan Surveys of Consumers preliminary measure 
for the next 5
 to 10
 years was the same as in the previous 
two months, while in February, the 3
-year
-ahead meas-
ure of inflation expectations produced by the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York was essentially unchanged 
from its January level.  The Survey of Professional Fore-

casters measure of PCE price inflation over the next
 10 years edged up in the first quarter, returning to its 
pre
-pandemic 
level.  A staff index of common inflation ex-
pectations, which summarizes the co
-movement of a 
wide variety of inflation expectations measures, was at 

about the same level in the fourth 
quarter of last year as 
in the third quarter.
 Consumer spending appeared to be increasing in the 
first quarter at a pace considerably faster, on balance, 

than in the fourth quarter of last year.  Real PCE ex-
panded strongly in January after declining over t
he pre-
ceding two months, with spending likely boosted by fed-

eral stimulus payments sent out in early January.  The 

components of the
 nominal retail sales data used 
by the 
Bureau of Economic Analysis to estimate PCE pointed 

to a step
-down in spending in February, but revised data 
for the previous month suggested an even stronger gain 

in January.  Spending in March was expected to be 
boosted by additional federal stimulus payments from 
the ARP, which started to be distributed around the mid-

dle of the month.  In addition, the personal saving rate 

jumped to an even higher level in January, and ongoing 
gains in labor earnings along with further fiscal support 
pointed to additional increases in accumulated house-

hold savings.  Moreover, the preliminary reading of c
on-

sumer sentiment from the Michigan survey moved up 
notably in early March to its highest level over the past 
year, reportedly reflecting the growing number of vac-

cinations and the enactment of the ARP, 
although
 con-
sumer sentiment remained below its level
s from 
just be-
fore the onset of the pandemic.
 Construction of single
-family homes
 and home sales re-
mained well above their pre
-pandemic levels
.  However, 
the incoming data for this sector were mixed.
  Starts of 
single
-family homes moved down notably over January 
and February, in part likely reflecting severe winter 

weather in February.  Starts of multifamily units also fell 

in February but by less than the strong increase seen in 
January.  Construction permits for single
-family homes 
moved down, on net, over January and February, point-

ing to some slowing in construction in coming months.  

Sales of both new and existing homes increased further 
in January, and home prices continued to rise briskly. 
 Business investment in equipment and intangibles was 
continuing to increase in the first quarter after rising ap-
preciably in the fourth quarter of last year.  Nominal 
shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding air-

craft expanded strongly in January, an
d rising orders for 

these goods pointed to further gains in business equip-
ment spending in coming months.  Business investment 
in the drilling and mining sector appeared to be increas-

ing further after turning up sharply in the fourth quarter, 

as crude oil 
and natural gas rigs in operation
Šan indica-
tor of drilling investment
Šcontinued to rise through 
early March with oil prices moving higher.  Nominal 
nonresidential construction spending rose somewhat in 

January, but investment in nonresidential structures o
ut-
side of the drilling and mining sector looked to remain 
weak in the current quarter after declining further in the 

fourth quarter, reflecting continued hesitation by busi-

nesses to commit to building projects with lengthy times 
to completion and uncertain
 future returns.
 Industrial production continued to rise solidly in January 
but then fell markedly in February, largely reflecting de-

clines in manufacturing and mining sector output caused 
by severe winter weather in the south
 central region of 
the country
 in the middle of that month.  Along with the 
severe weather, a cutback in the production of motor 
vehicles and parts also reflected a global shortage of 
semiconductors.  New orders indexes in national and re-
gional manufacturing surveys pointed toward solid in-

creases in factory output in the coming months, 
al-though
 reports of shortages in materials and labor, as 
well as bottlenecks in transportation, signaled some po-

tential restraints on the pace of the manufacturing recov-

ery. 
 Total real government purchases appeared to be rising 
in the first quarter after edging down in the fourth quar-
ter.  
Al
though
 data through February indicated that de-
fense spending was moving down, a likely bounceback 

in nondefense spending was expected to lift total federal 
purchase
s.  State and local government purchases looked 
to be increasing, as the payrolls of these governments 

expanded, on net, over January and February, and nom-

inal state and local construction spending increased sol-
idly in January.  Moreover, additional federal support for 
state and local governments included in the ARP, along 

with 
an improved
 outlook for state and local tax reve-
nues, pointed to further notable increases in state and 
local purchases. 
 Data for December and January showed a narrower 
nominal U.S.
 international trade deficit than in Novem-
ber.  Both imports and exports continued to rebound 
   from their collapse in the first half of last year.  Goods 
imports in January were much higher than a year earlier, 
with continued gains in most categories.  Nomi
nal goods 
exports in January nearly recovered to their level from a 
year earlier, with particular strength in exports of capital 

goods and industrial supplies.  Services imports and ex-
ports remained depressed, weighed down by the contin-
ued suspension of most international travel.  
 Recent data pointed to a slowdown in economic activity 
across foreign economies around the turn of the year, as 
tight social
-distancing restrictions were imposed to rein 
in a new wave of COVID
-19 infections in various parts 
of the world, most notably in Europe and Latin America.  
Even so, economies appeared to be better adapted to 
operating under restrictions than during previous waves 
of infections.  Manufacturing activity continued to gen-

erally outperform activity in the services sector, and 

manufactured exports from China and some other Asian 
economies remained strong, especially to the United 
States.  Inflation rebounded in many foreign economies, 

reflecting rising energy prices and other temporary fac-

tors.  However, underlying
 inflationary pressures re-
mained subdued.
 Staff Review of the Financial Situation
 Investors appeared to 
have
 become more optimistic 
about the economic outlook over the intermeeting pe-
riod against the backdrop of progress on COVID
-19 
vaccinations, signs of stronger domestic spending, and 
additional fiscal stimulus.  The nominal Treasury yield 

curve steepened markedly, largely because of increases 
in longer
-term real yields,
 although
 measures of 
inflation 
compensation also 
increased further.  Despite the spi
kes 
in equity market volatility early in the intermeeting pe-
riod
, spurred by heavy trading concentrated in a few spe-
cific stocks and subsequent concerns over the rapid rise 

in longer
-term interest rates, broad equity price indexes 
rose on net.  Consistent with the stronger outlook, 

spreads on high
-yield corporate bonds narrowed.  Fi-
nancing conditions for businesses with access to capital 
markets and households with high credit scores re-

mained broadly accommodative, but conditions 
stayed 

tight for other borrowers.  
 The Treasury yield curve steepened over the intermeet-

ing period, with 5
- 
and 10
-year yields rising markedly.  
Measures of inflation compensation increased moder-

ately, on net, continuing the trend observed over recent 
months.  However, in contrast to recent months, most 
of the recent increase in longer
-term Treasury yields was 
accounted for by higher TIPS
-implied real yields.  Mar-
ket participants attributed the increases in longer
-term 
yields in part to increased investor optimism about the 

economic outlook and expectations of higher Treasury 
debt issuance.  On February 25, yields rose especially 
sharply
.  
Market depth became thin, and bid
-ask spreads 
widened, but Treasury market liquidity gradually recov-

ered over the following days.  Swaption
-implied volatili-
ties of longer
-term interest rates rose notably.  
 The expected path for the federal funds rate over the 

next few years, as implied by a straight read of overnight 

index swap quotes, rose substantially since the previous 
FOMC 
meeting and moved above 25 basis points in the 
first quarter of 2023, about three quarters sooner than 
expected 
at the time of the January meeting.  
 Broad stock price indexes increased, on net, over the in-
termeeting period, consistent with increased inves
tor 
optimism about the economic outlook and the enact-
ment of the ARP.  Stocks in cyclically sensitive industries 

such as energy, banking, and small caps recorded sizable 
gains, while other sectors experienced mixed perfor-
mance.  One
-month option
-implied vo
latility on the 
S&P 500
Šthe VIX
Šfluctuated over a wide range dur-
ing the intermeeting period but moved lower on balance.  
Spreads of corporate bond yields over comparable
- 
maturity Treasury yields were roughly unchanged on 
 investment
-grade corporate bonds but narrowed for 
speculative
-grade bonds.  
 Conditions in short
-term funding markets remained sta-
ble over the intermeeting period.  Spreads on commer-
cial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit across 

different tenors were little changed and remained 
near 
historically low levels.  Assets under management 
(AUM) of government money market funds (MMFs) 

rose over the intermeeting period, whereas AUM of 

prime MMFs declined somewhat.
 The effective federal funds rate and the Secured Over-

night Financing Rate averaged 7 basis points and 3
 basis 
points, respectively, over the intermeeting period, de-

creasing somewhat relative to the 
previous intermeeting 
period average amid a net decrease in Treasury bill issu-

ance and rising reserves.  There continued to be no par-

ticipation in the Federal Reserve™s repo operations, but 

participation in the Federal Reserve™s ON RRP
 increased 
a little.  Amid stable market conditions, there was no 

take
-up in the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Fa-
cility 
or

ng Facility.
 Improved U.S. economic growth prospects and opti-
mism about the eventual lifting of social
-distancing and 
related restrictions globally were major drivers of asset 
prices abroad, spurring sizable increases in sovereign 
   yields in advanced foreig
n economies.  In response to 
rising yields, the Reserve Bank of Australia increased its 
bond purchases, and the European Central Bank indi-
cated it would increase the pace of its bond purchases 

going forward.  The broad dollar index rose modestly, 

with more
 notable appreciation against currencies of 
emerging market economies (EMEs).  EME sovereign 

spreads edged up
, and flows into EME bond funds fell 
back later in the period amid the rise in yields in ad-

vanced economies.  However, flows into dedicated 
EME equity funds remained strong.  Overall, foreign eq-
uity indexes increased slightly in most major markets.
 Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses in cap-

ital markets remained broadly accommodative over the 
intermeeting period, supported by low interest
 rates and 
high equity valuations.  Gross and net corporate bond 
issuance
s 
were 
solid in January and February. 
 Gross is-
suance of leveraged loans was strong in January, driven 
mainly by refinancing activity, as primary
-market spreads 
compressed notably since the end of last year in re-
sponse to strong investor demand for such loans.  Eq-

uity raised through traditional initial public offerings and 
seasoned equity offerings continued to be strong in Jan-
uary and February, and initial equity offerings by special
 purpose acquisition companies remained exceptionally 

high.  Commercial and industrial loans outstanding on 
banks™ balance sheets continued to decline through Feb-
ruary as loan paydowns 
persisted 
and demand for new 
bank credit reportedly remained subdued.  
 Corporate earnings continued to recover while the credit 
quality of nonfinancial corporations improved further.  
Corporate bond defaults declined in December and Jan-

uary and reached levels substantially below their 2019 

average.  In addition, the volume of
 nonfinancial corpo-
rate credit rating upgrades modestly outpaced down-

grades over the first two months of 2021.  Market indi-

cators of future default expectations moved lower.  
 Financing conditions for small businesses remained 
tight.  Demand for loans rema
ined depressed
Šand loan 
originations fell in December last year to about the same 
level seen in August
Šafter the spike in lending associ-
ated with the first round of the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram.  Long
-term delinquencies remained elevated rela-
tive to recent years but were at levels significantly below 
those experienced during the 
Global 
Financial 
Crisis.  
Municipal market financing conditions 
stayed accom-
modative over the intermeeting period.   
 For commercial real estate (CRE) financed through cap-
ital markets, financing conditions remained accommo-

dative over the intermeeting period.  Agency CMBS 
spreads narrowed further with strong issuance in De-

cember and January.  Spreads on non
-agency CMBS als
o tightened, although
 triple
-B spreads stayed at elevated 
levels compared with pre
-pandemic levels.  Issuance of 
non
-agency CMBS remained weak relative to pre
- 
pandemic levels.  CRE loan growth at banks was weak, 
on net, through February, consistent with 
tight bank 
lending standards.
 Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market 

tightened somewhat over the intermeeting period
 but re-
mained accommodative for stronger borrowers.  Mort-

gage rates for most borrowers increased but stayed near 

historical
ly low levels, supporting elevated refinance and 
purchase activity through January.  Credit was broadly 
available to higher
-score borrowers meeting standard 
conforming loan criteria but tightened further for bor-
rowers with lower credit scores.  The share o
f mortgages 
in forbearance was unchanged.  
 Financing conditions in consumer credit markets re-
mained generally accommodative for borrowers with 

strong credit scores but were still tight for those with 

non
prime scores.  Auto loan balances continued to grow 
in January, while credit card balances declined.  Interest 
rates on new credit card offers to borrowers with prime 

credit scores continued to trend down, on net, through 

December.  
In contrast, offer rates to nonprime borrow-
ers rose further.  Conditions in
 the asset
-backed securi-
ties market were stable during the intermeeting period.
 Staff Economic Outlook
 The U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for 
the March FOMC meeting was considerably stronger 
than the January forecast.  Real GDP growth 
appea
red 

to be picking
 up at the beginning of this year by more 
than the staff had expected, likely reflecting both a 
faster
-than
-anticipated easing in social distancing and a 
more rapid response by households to the fiscal support 
package enacted in late Decem
ber.  Moreover, the size 
of the ARP enacted in March was considerably larger 
than what the staff had assumed in the January projec-
tion.  All told, real GDP growth was projected to be sub-

stantial this year and the unemployment rate was fore-

cast to decline m
arkedly, as the staff™s projection also 
continued to anticipate that widespread vaccination 
would allow for further easing in social distancing this 

year.  Real GDP growth was expected to step down in 

2022 and 2023 but still outpace that of potential over 
this period, leading to a decline in the unemployment 
rate to historically low levels, as monetary policy was as-

sumed to remain highly accommodative.
    Incoming data on inflation 
were
 a little above what the 
staff had expected.  The 12
-month changes in total
 and 
core PCE prices were expected to transitorily move 
above 2
 percent in coming months, as the low inflation 
readings from the spring of last year dropped out of the 

calculation window.  In addition, inflation was forecast 
to be temporarily boosted this year by the expected 
emergence of some production bottlenecks and supply 

constraints.  Following the 
transitory
 increase this year, 
inflation was projected to run a bit below 2 percent next 
year and then to reach 2 percent by 2023, reflecting tight 
resourc
e utilization in product and labor markets.    
 The staff continued to see
 the uncertainty surrounding 
the outlook as elevated.  Moreover, the uncertain course 
of the pandemic, particularly
 the emergence of more
-contagious strains of the coronavirus in the United 
States and elsewhere, 
was
 still viewed as tilting the risks 
to the economic outlook to the downside.  However, 
given the resilience of the economy in the face of the 
earlier surge in
 new COVID
-19 cases, hospitalizations, 
and deaths and the magnitude of fiscal support enacted, 

the downside risks to the economic outlook were seen 
as smaller than for the previous projection.  The staff 
viewed the risks of upside inflationary pressures as
 hav-
ing increased since the previous forecast and now saw 

the risks to the inflation projection as balanced.  
 Participants™ Views on Current Conditions and the 

Economic Outlook
 In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants 

submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes 
for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-
tion for each year from 
2021 through 2023 and over the 
longer run, based on their individual assessments of ap-

propriate 
monetary policy, including the path of the fed-
eral fu
nds rate.  The longer
-run projections represented 
each participant™s assessment of the
 rate to which each 
variable would be expected to converge, over time, un-

der appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of 
further shocks to the economy.
  
A Summary of Eco-
nomic Projections was released to the public following 
the conclusion of the meeting.
 In their discussion of current conditions, participants 
noted that the COVID
-19 pandemic was causing tre-
mendous human and economic hardship across the 
United States and around the world.  Following a mod-

eration in the pace of the recovery, indicators of eco-
nomic activity and employment had turned up recently, 
although
 the sectors most adversely affected by the pan-
demic remained weak.  Inflation continued to run below
 2 percent.  Overall financial conditions remained accom-

modative, in part reflecting policy measures to support 
the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households 
and businesses.  Participants 
noted 
that the path of the 
economy would depend significantl
y on the course of 
the virus, including progress on vaccinations, and that 
the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh 
on economic activity, employment, and inflation and 

posed considerable risks to the economic outlook.
 Participants observed that the pace of the economic re-
covery had picked up 
recently
 and that the economy 
continued to show resilience in the face of the pandemic.  
They noted encouraging developments regarding the 

pandemic, including significant declines in the number 
of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths 
over the inter-
meeting perio
d 
as well as a pickup in the pace of vac-
cinations.  In light of these developments as well as the 
extent of the recent fiscal policy support, participants 
significantly 
revised up their projections for real GDP 
growth this year
 compared with the projection
s they 
submitted last December
.  They noted, however, that 
economic activity and employment were currently well 

below levels consistent with maximum employment.  
 Participants observed that the economic downturn had 
not fallen equally on all Americans and that lower
- 
income and Black and Hispanic households had been 
disproportionately affected 
by the pandemic.  A number 
of participants stressed that recently enacted fiscal 
sup-
port
 would help address 
some of 
the hardships faced by 
these groups and that monetary policy 
would 
also help 
by promoting the economy™s return to the Committee™s 

goals of broad
-based and inclusive 
maximum employ-
ment and price stability. 
 Participants observed that household spending had risen 
notably so far this year and 
anticipated
 tha
t further gains 
in consumer spending 
would 
contribute significantly to 
the economic recovery.  While household spending on 
services that typically require close personal contact re-
mained weak, participants expected spending on these 
services 
would
 improve 
as vaccinations became more 
widespread
, social
-distancing measures were relaxed
, 
and the public became less wary of close personal inter-
actions
.  Participants anticipated consumer spending 
would be bolstered by 
the 
recently enacted fiscal stimu-
lus packages as well as by accommodative monetary pol-
icy.  Many participants 
also
 pointed to the elevated level 
of household savings and judged that the re
lease of 
pent
-up demand could boost consumption growth further as 

social distancing waned.  Participants also observed that 

residential construction continued to be solid and home 
   sales remained robust
 in part 
because of
 low interest 
rates
.  Low inventor
y w
as viewed as an important factor 
supporting 
strong gains
 in housing 
prices
.   With respect to the business sector, participants ob-
served that business equipment investment had contin-

ued to increase and that readings on new orders and 
shipments of capital 
goods remained strong.  While 
some District contacts continued to report that firms in 

industries such as 
CRE 
or leisure, travel, and hospitality 
were struggling from pandemic
-related social distancing, 
other District contacts reported that activity in these in-

dustries had started to improve.  Participants noted that 

surveys of business activity had picked up recently and 

that many District contacts were growing increasingly 
optimistic about business prospects 
given 
ongoing pro-
gress on vaccinations.  Partic
ipants also discussed re-
ports of shortages in materials
, key intermediate inputs,
 and labor as well as bottlenecks in
 shipping
.  A few par-
ticipants noted that higher crop prices were continuing 

to boost income in the agricultural sector.  Several par-

ticipa
nts judged that the support provided by the ARP 
could improve 
the financial positions of small firms that 
had been adversely affected by the pandemic.
 Participants observed that labor market conditions had 

improved
 recently, as payroll employment registered 
strong gains in February and the unemployment rate fell 
to 6.2 percent.  Even so, payroll employment was about 
9.5 million 
jobs 
below its pre
-pandemic level
, and labor 
market conditions for those in the most disa
dvantaged 

communities 
were 
viewed as lagging behind those of 
other households.  Moreover, participants noted that 

employment in the leisure and hospitality sector was still 

down substantially from its pre
-pandemic level 
despite a 
sharp rebound in February.
  Participants generally ex-
pected strong job gains to continue over coming months 

and into the medium term
, 
supported by accommoda-
tive fiscal and monetary policies as well as by continued 

progress on vaccinations
, further reopening of 
sectors 
most affected
 by the 
pandemic,
 and the associated re-
covery in economic activity.  However, participants 

noted that the economy was far from achieving the 

Committee™s broad
-based and inclusive 
goal of 
maxi-
mum employment.  Some participants commented that 

labor force par
ticipation 
continued to be
 held down by 
workers™ 
health concerns and additional childcare re-
sponsibilities associated with virtual schooling and that 
the pace of 
recovery in the labor market would depend 
importantly 
on how rapidly those affected
 by these i
s-sues 
could rejoin the labor force.  Several participants 
noted that the speed of the labor market recovery 
also 

depended on factors such as the 
movement
 of workers 
across industries 
and occupations in a 
restructuring
 economy
 or the effects of technological change on the 
demand for labor.  Several participants suggested that 
the ARP could hasten the recovery
, 
which could help
 limit longer
-term damage in labor markets caused by the 
pandemic.  
 Participants observed that headlin
e 
PCE inflation
 con-
tinued to run below 2 percent
.  In the near term, t
he 
 12-month change in PCE prices was expected to move 
above 2 percent as the low inflation readings from the 
spring of last year drop out of the calculation.  Most par-
ticipants also poi
nted to supply constraints 
that could 
contribute to price increases for some goods in coming 

months 
as the economy continued to reopen.  
After 
the
 transitory
 effects of these factors
 fade
, however, partici-
pants generally anticipated that 
annual inflation 
readings 
would
 edge down
 next year.  Subsequently, participants 
expected
 that
 inflation would
 likely 
move along a trajec-
tory consistent with achieving the Committee™s objec-

tives over time
, supported by strong 
aggregate demand
, which participants 
expected would be
 driven 
in part
 by 
accommodative monetary and fiscal policies
.   Participants discussed market
- 
and survey
-based 
measures of longer
-term inflation expectations and their 
implications for the inflation outlook.  Market
-based 
measures of inf
lation compensation at the 
5- 
and 
10-year 
horizons had continued to move up over the intermeet-

ing period, while survey
-based measures of inflation ex-
pectations were little changed on balance.  A number of 

participants indicated that the increases in market
-based 
measures of inflation compensation from the very low 

levels of last spring 
were consistent with the view that 

inflation was likely to move 
along a path
 over time con-
sistent with the Committee™s goal
s. 
Participants noted that overall financial conditions re-

mained 
highly 
accommodative, in part reflecting the 
stance of monetary policy.  Participants commented on 

the notable rise in longer
-term Treasury yields that oc-
curred over the intermeeting period and generally 

viewed 
it
 as reflecting 
the improved economic outlook, 
some firming in inflation expectations, and expectations 

for increased Treasury debt issuance.  
Disorderly condi-
tions in Treasury markets or a persistent rise in yields 

that could jeopardize progress toward the Committee™s 

goals
 were seen as cause for concern
.  While overall fi-
nancial conditions were still seen as accommodative, a 
number of participants remarked that 
financing condi-
tions remained challenging for many small businesses.  
A    co
uple of participants expressed concern that highly ac-
commodative financial conditions could lead to exces-
sive risk
-taking and the buildup of financial imbalances.
 While generally acknowledging that the medium
-term 
outlook for real GDP growth and employment
 had im-
proved, participants continued to see the uncertainty 

surrounding that outlook as elevated.  Participants 
agreed that the path of the economy would depend sig-

nificantly on the course of the virus, including
 progress 
on vaccinations.  Most participants indicated that the 
pandemic continued to pose considerable risks to the 
economic outlook, including risks associated with new 

more-
contagious virus strains, obstacles in getting suffi-
cient numbers of the public vaccinated, or social
- 
distancing fatigue.  A few participants pointed to risks 

associated with stress in the CRE sector or to risks asso-

ciated with the unwinding of mortgage forbearance and 

eviction moratoriums provided to households.  With re-
gard to upside risks, some participants pointed to the 
possibility that fiscal policy could have a more expan-

sionary effect than anticipated, that households could 

display a greater
-than
-expected willingness to spend out 
of accumulated savings, or that widespread vaccinations 

and easing of social distancing could result in a more 

rapid boost to spending and employment than antici-

pated.  
 Most participants noted that they viewed the risks to the 
outlook for inflation as broadly balanced.  Several re-

marked that supply disruptions and strong de
mand 
could push up price inflation more than anticipated.  
Several participants commented that the factors that had 
contributed to low inflation during the previous expan-

sion could 
again 
exert more downward pressure on in-
flation than expected.
 In their consideration of the stance of monetary policy, 

participants reaffirmed the Federal Reserve
™s commit-

ment to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. 

economy during this challenging time, thereby promot-
ing the Committee
™s statutory goals of maximum em-
ployment and price stability.  Participants noted that in-

dicators of economic activity and employment had 

turned up recently after a period of moderation, 
al-though
 the sectors most adversely affected by the pan-
demic remained weak. 
 Despite these positive 
indicators 
and an improved public health situation
, p
articipants 
agreed that the economy remained far from the Com-
mittee
™s longer
-run goals and that the path ahead re-
mained highly uncertain, with the pandemic continuing 
to pose considerable risks to the outlook.  Consequently, 

participants judged that the current stance of policy 
and 
policy guidance remained
 appropriate to foster further 
economic recovery as well as to achieve inflation that av-
erages 2
 percent over time and longer
-term inflation ex-
pectation
s that remain well anchored at 2 percent. 
 Participants judged that the Committee
™s current guid-
ance 
for the 
federal funds rate and asset purchases was 
serving 
the economy
 well.  They noted that 
a 
benefit of 
the outcome
-based guidance was that it did not n
eed to 
be recalibrated often in response to incoming data or 
the 
evolving outlook.  Participants also noted the im-
portance of communicating to the public that the exist-
ing guidance, together with the new monetary policy 

framework 
as 
delineated in the revised Statement on 
Longer
-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, meant 
that the path of the federal funds rate and 
the balance 
sheet 
depend on actual progress toward reaching the 
Committee™s maximum
-employment and inflation goals.  
In particular, 
various 
participants noted that changes in 
the path of policy should be based primarily on observed 

outcomes rather than forecasts.
   Participants agreed that 
overall 
financial conditions were 
accommodative. 
 They noted that 
the Federal Reserve
™s asset purchases since last March had materially eased fi-

nancial conditions and were providing substantial sup-

port to the economy.  Participants noted that it would 

likely be some time until substantial further progres
s to-
ward the Committee™s maximum
-employment and 
price
-stability goals would be realized and that, con-
sistent with the Committee™s outcome
-based guidance, 
asset purchases would continue at least at the current 
pace until then.  A number of participants high
lighted 
the importance of the Committee clearly communicating 

its assessment of progress toward its longer
-run goals 
well in advance of
 the time when it could be judged sub-
stantial enough to warrant
 a change in the pace of asset 
purchases.
  
The timing of such communications would 
depend on the evolution of the economy and the pace 

of progress toward the Committee™s goals.
 Committee Policy Action
 In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, 

members agreed that the COVID
-19 pandemic was 
causing tremendous human and economic hardship 
across the United States and around the world.  They 
noted that following a moderation in the pace of the re-

covery, indicators of economic activity and employment 

had turned up recently, 
although
 the sectors most ad-
ver
sely affected by the pandemic remained weak. 
 Infla-
tion continued to run below 2 percent. 
 Overall financial 
conditions remained accommodative, in part reflecting 

policy measures to support the economy and the flow of 
   credit to U.S. households and 
businesses.  Members also 
remarked that the path of the economy would depend 
significantly on the course of the virus, including pro-
gress on vaccinations.  In addition, members agreed that 

the ongoing public health crisis continued to weigh on 

economic act
ivity, employment, and inflation and was 
posing considerable risks to the economic outlook.
 Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was commit-

ted to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. 

economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its 
maximum
-employment and price
-stability goals. 
 All 
members reaffirmed that, in accordance with the Com-
mittee
™s goals to achieve maximum employment and in-

flation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run and 
with inflation running persistently below this 
longer
-run 
goal, they would aim to achieve inflation moderately 
above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 

2 percent over time and longer
-term inflation expecta-
tions remain well anchored at 2 percent. 
 Members ex-
pected to maintain an accommodative stance of mone-

tary policy until those outcomes were achieved.
 All members agreed to maintain the target range for the 
federal funds rate at 0 to 
¼ 
percent, and they expected 
that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range 
until labor market conditions had reached levels con-

sistent with the Committee
™s assessments of maximum 
employment and inflation had risen to 2 percent and was 

on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.  

In addition, members agreed that it would be appropri-

ate for the Federal Reserve to continue to increase its 
holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80
 billion per 
month and agency mortgage
-backed securities by at least 

$40 billion per month until substantial further progress 

had been made toward the Commit
tee
™s maximum
- 
employment and price
-stability goals. 
 They judged that 
these asset purchases would help foster smooth market 

functioning and accommodative financial conditions, 

thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and 
businesses.
 Members agr
eed that, in assessing the appropriate stance 
of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the 

implications of incoming information for the economic 
outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the 
stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the
 event 
that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of 

the Committee
™s goals. 
 Members also agreed that, in as-
sessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they 

would take into account a wide range of information, in-
cluding readings on public health, labor market condi-

tions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and 
financial and international developments.
 With regard to the postmeeting statement, 
in light of the 
notably positive tone
 of recent data, members 
judged
 that it was appropr
iate to 
incorporate that development 
in 
the description of the economic situation with the lan-
guage 
that
 ﬁindicators of economic activity and employ-
ment ha
ve turned up recently.ﬂ  Members also deter-
mined that, with oil prices having essentially retraced 
their pandemic
-related declines
, it was appropriate to 
re-
move the reference to oil prices as a factor holding down 
consumer price inflation
 and to simply state
 that ﬁ
infla-
tion continues to run below 2 percent.ﬂ
  Regarding the 
directive to the Desk, m
embers agreed that the directive 

should incorporate the proposed increase in the per
-counterparty limit for the ON RRP facility to $80 billion.
 At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee 
voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute 

transactions in the S
ystem 
Open 
Market 
Account
 in ac-
cordance with the following domestic policy directive, 
for release 
at 2:00
 p.m.: 
ﬁEffective March
 18, 2021, the Federal Open 
Market Committee directs the Desk to:

essary to maintain the federal funds rate in 

a target range of 0
 to ¼ percent.

creased at the discretion of the Chair.
  Roll over at auction all principal payments 

from the Federal Reserve™s holdings of

amounts for purchases and reinvestments, 
if needed for operational reasons.
  Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap 
transactions as necessary to facilitate settle-

ment of the Federal Reserve™s agency MBS

 The vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below for release at 2:00
 p.m.: 
ﬁThe Federal Reserve is committed to using its 
full range of tools to support the U.S. economy 

in this challenging time, thereby promoting its 
maximum employment and price stability goals.
 The COVID
-19 pandemic is causing tremen-
dous human and economic hardship across the 
United States and around the world.  Following 
a moderation in the pace of the recovery, indi-
cators of economic activity and employment 

have turned up recently, 
although
 th
e sectors 
most adversely affected by the pandemic remain 
weak.  Inflation continues to run below 2
 per-
cent.  Overall financial conditions remain ac-
commodative, in part reflecting policy measures 

to support the economy and the flow of credit 
to U.S. househo
lds and businesses.  
 The path of the economy will depend signifi-
cantly on the course of the virus, including pro-

gress on vaccinations.  The ongoing public 
health crisis continues to weigh on economic 
activity, employment, and inflation, and poses 

consider
able risks to the economic outlook.
 The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em-
ployment and inflation at the rate of 2
 percent 
over the longer run.  With inflation running per-
sistently below this longer
-run goal, the Com-
mittee will aim to achieve inflation m
oderately 
above 2
 percent for some time so that inflation 
averages 2
 percent over time and longer
-term 
inflation expectations remain well anchored at 

2 
percent.  The Committee expects to maintain 
an accommodative stance of monetary policy 

until these outco
mes are achieved.  The Com-
mittee decided to keep the target range for the 

federal funds rate at 0
 to ¼
 percent and expects 
it will be appropriate to maintain this target 

range until labor market conditions have 
reached levels consistent with the Committee™
s assessments of maximum employment and in-
flation has risen to 2
 percent and is on track to 
moderately exceed 2
 percent for some time.  In 
addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to 

increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at 

least $80
 billion per month and of agency 
 mortgage-
backed securities by at least $40
 bil-
lion per month until substantial further progress 

has been made toward the Committee™s maxi-

mum employment and price stability goals.  

These asset purchases help foster smooth mar-
ket functioning and accommodative financial 
conditions, thereby supporting the flow of 

credit to households and businesses.  
 In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary 
policy, the Committee will continue to monitor 
the implications of incoming information fo
r 

the economic outlook.  The Committee would 

be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary 
policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could 
impede the attainment of the Committee™s 

goals.  The Committee™s assessments will take
 into account a wide range of information, in-
cluding readings on public health, labor market 
conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex-

pectations, and financial and international de-

velopments.ﬂ
